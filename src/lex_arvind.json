It combines search and large language models, LLMs, in a way that produces answers where every part of the answer has a citation to human-created sources on the web. This significantly reduces LLM hallucinations and makes it much easier and more reliable to use for research and general, curiosity-driven, late night rabbit hole explorations that I often engage in."

Perplexity is part search engine, part LLM, so how does it work and what role does each part of that, the search and the LLM, play in serving the final result? - Perplexity is best described as an answer engine. So you ask it a question, you get an answer except the difference is all the answers are backed by sources. This is, like, how an academic writes a paper. Now that referencing part, the sourcing part is where the search engine part comes in."

It's been instructed with that one particular instruction of given a bunch of links and paragraphs, write a concise answer for the user"

Anything else that you say in a paper is more like an opinion, it's a very simple statement but pretty profound in how much it forces you to say things that are only right.

If you're just trying to take on Google by building another 10 blue links search engine and with some other differentiation, which could be privacy or no ads or something like that, it's not enough.

One of the biggest ways they make money is by showing ads - Yeah. - as part of the 10 links.

Like for example, Sundar announced that Google Cloud and YouTube together are on 100 billion dollar annual recurring rate right now. So that alone should qualify Google as a trillion dollar company if you use a 10x multiplier and all that.

It's the largest real estate of the internet where the most traffic is recorded per day and there are a bunch of ad words. You can actually go and look at this product called adwords.google.com, where you get for certain ad words, what's the search frequency per word.

And if you get a good ROI in terms of conversions, like people make more purchases on your site through the Google referral, then you're gonna spend more for bidding against that word. And the price for each AdWord is based on a bidding system, an auction system. So it's dynamic. So that way the margins are high. - By the way, it's brilliant.

The principle in Perplexity is, you're not supposed to say anything that you don't retrieve, which is even more powerful than RAG 'cause RAG just says, okay, use this additional context and write an answer.

One is you have all the information you need for the query, the model is just not smart enough to understand the query at a deeply semantic level"

There's, like, a bunch of bots that crawl the web. - How does Perplexity Bot work? Like so that's a beautiful little creature.

You basically have to render, headless render and then websites are more modern these days. It's not just the HTML, there's a lot of JavaScript rendering.

So that's the crawling."

        "speaker": "Perplexity CEO",

It's not like that. Because packing all the knowledge about a webpage into one vector space representation is very, very difficult. First of all, vector embeddings are not magically working for text.

And it's very hard to make these vector embeddings have different dimensions be disentangle from each other and capturing different semantics. So what retrieval, typically...

You're obviously gonna... At the scale of, like, queries you handle as you keep going in a logarithmic dimension, you go from 10,000 queries a day to 100,000, to a million to 10 million, you're gonna encounter more mistakes.
